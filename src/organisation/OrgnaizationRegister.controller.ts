/// My question is that the person who is registered is either admin or normal user in the oranization
// when the orgnization onboarding process is completed by him he will be considered as admin or main
// of that organization as he is the one who completed the organization process.

// Organization and Organization Admin both will be separate table
// OrganizationAdmin table will consist the foriegn key of that organization so we can know of which
// organization he is the admin. And

// for that I need to create a seprate DTO and everything for that organizationAdmin person
// I will creaet an user while registering but and there will be a status mentioning that
// he is a admin or not isAdmin:true or false
// so if a user until completes the onbaording process he will not be considered as admin
// and the status will remain false and once the process is completed the status will be true
// for the admin the schema for now looks like this

// id
// email
// password
// isAdmin
// OrganizationId

// for one organization there can be multiple admins but for one Admin
// there can be only one organization. so it's a manytoone relationship
